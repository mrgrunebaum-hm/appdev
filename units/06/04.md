### Due Friday, May 28

You have spent the school year compiling data on our community and the unique problems presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, identifying potential design solutions to problems you've observed, and refining your designs alongside your peers and with the help of members of our community. Now it's time to package your work in a way that shows off your knowledge, wisdom, efforts, and unique design philosophies.

For the final deliverable in your Mobile Apps journey, prepare a single-page 'pitch webpage' documenting your process of getting the design right. This page should provide context and describe motivation for your final design using evidence collected throughout the year. Briefly summarize each of the previous steps (deliverables) of this project as motivation and provide links to the in-depth write-ups you did for each deliverable. The previous deliverable posts you created can be placed into an 'Appendix', which can be a tab on the main page or a section at the bottom of your 'pitch page'. 

Basically, I'm asking you to redesign your website so that it contains one main page that effectively showcases and pitches your project to an average reader. Your original write-ups for the various deliverables can be linked throughout the writing on your main page, as well as in an 'Appendix'. Your page should be structured as a report of your UX research and design process, structured according to the below outline.

Envision this page as a UX Design Project portfolio webpage. [This](https://www.chloefan.com/#/mm-expedited-claims/) is a professional example of a similar type of page that documents the overall design process, including links to further reading. You are encouraged to get creative and customize the design of your page, as long as you make sure you're documenting your group's UX process and findings!

  1. **Title**
    * A short, creative, marketable title capturing the main idea
  3. **Each team member's name and role**
  4. **Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview**
    * A concise statement of the problem you identified, and evidence to support why it's a problem, as well as a brief synopsis of your proposed solution. You can reuse language from your initial report of the problem, but you should also update it to reflect the current form of your design.
  6. **Contextual Inquiry Results & Key Tasks**
    * Briefly outline your testing process, including your method and your participants. This process probably evolved some in the course of your project. Include a retrospective on how you refined your process, separate from how you refined your design. Discuss your process of identifying the central tasks that users of your design will seek to accomplish.

### Accessibility [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B19bjy00h0PafNCk5_5P4VSAuwjhnLGKCpAi93HnP5M/edit?usp=sharing)

Here are some slides comprising a brief lesson on accessibility in tech/engineering and design, including links to additional resources on the last slide. To have a more focused discussion on accessibility and how we can apply these ideas/strategies to our projects, we'll be working on this [activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQEJ8hRaZCaN765jJbrZB3cgxwOPLcQgR9ROSQhIug4/edit?usp=sharing), which can also be found on Google Classroom.

# Defining Tasks and Users [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LABOIreCE4z4fU6MsxXU8IhkDvxrQZWFfyTCzr7jo-4/edit?usp=sharing)

Here are some slides with image examples of old school UX research techniques. They come from a very helpful [reading](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WicbiBF4Ft9C_kdQb32hBkD2bIMmSCbP&authuser=0) for understanding how scenarios can be used to aid in defining needs and requirements of users and technology, as well as how to use task analysis to clearly define the functions of a design in terms of how it satisfies a need for users. Also, [here is a link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pruitt-grudinold.pdf) to a helpful article about user personas and how they can be used to clearly define the requirements of a design for a new piece of technology.

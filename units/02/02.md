## Contextual Inquiries [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GWQIDycVeBcmTK1iePPiY0RffFS7yMPDFvL6TFW3nxY/edit?usp=sharing)

What HCI research methods exist for getting to know our potential user base? How can we utilize the precious few in-person days we have remaining to learn as much as we can about the Horace Mann community and the needs of the many different groups of people that make up this community? 

Contextual inquiries are a simple but powerful UX research method. This is not your run-of-the-mill focus group â€“ we will be meeting with our users and observing them in context, just like in fly-on-the-wall. However, this time you will have a plan and you will be asking targeted questions to actively seek out the most pertinent information for your app designs.

## Due next week, Friday, November 6

This is the first milestone of your yearlong project and, in many ways, can feel like a make-or-break moment. You are working with your team for the first time and you are drafting a proposal for the idea that you will spend the rest of the academic year testing, implementing, and testing again. While this is a momentous occasion, it is by no means make-or-break. We will be iteratively returning to the ideas, insights, and action plans outlined in your *Group Project Proposal* and continually improving and updating your projects based on the results we gain from testing. Technology is a living thing, it changes as the needs of humans change, and your designs will be no exception. Have fun with this proposal – be creative and put yourself into what you write as a group – knowing the whole time that none of this is final and that no piece of software is ever "finished".

## Objectives

This assignment is intended to evaluate your ability to:
  * Work as a group to brainstorm new ideas and insights, drawing from your diverse knowledge, skillsets, and lived experiences to come up with a useful and well-planned piece of mobile software
  * Apply HCI concepts to draft a comprehensive User Experience (UX) research plan that will yield useful, actionable data to inform your design
    * Identify the potential users, stakeholders, and anyone else whose experience must be considered in the design of your app
  * Establish equitable and healthy working habits with your group so that work is distributed evenly and everyone enjoys the process
    * Outline these norms in a Team Contract document
  * Create a GitHub website for your group that everyone can access and update

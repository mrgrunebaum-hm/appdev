## Activity

In pairs, make a prototype for a website or mobile app design (you choose!). You are free to choose a theme to base the website/web-app around (e.g. clubs, pubs, sports teams, shows, music, etc). 

You will make this prototype on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). Save your work by clicking save and copying and pasting the URL, which will change after you save. This will be a link to your anonymous, public fiddle, which you will submit as your website/web-app for this activity.

Here's an [example website](https://jsfiddle.net/3w2fg0L1/2/).

### Index Page

The contents of this page are up to your discretion, but should involve work from each team member. This will
be the landing page of your website and should be made accordingly. This page should include:

  > a title
  > both group members names
  > links to all individual pages
  > one or more images with alt text

### Individual Page(s)

Both team members should create at least one of their own pages. The page can include whatever content you like, but should include at least:

  > your name
  > a title
  > a link back to the index page
  > paragraphs with corresponding headings
  > at least one image with alt text
  > a button that does something when clicked

### Submission

Submit a link to your fiddle along with your answers to the questions, written in a Google Doc.

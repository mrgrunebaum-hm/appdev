Let's get ready to start our first mobile app design projects! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Github
Github is the platform we will use to host our portfolio websites – you will be submitting the vast majority of your labs as published pages on your website.

## Github Pages
Once you have a Github account and you are signed in, you can set up your portfolio website. Go to [the Beautiful Jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#build-your-website-in-3-steps) and follow the instructions.

Only do steps 1 and 2! Don't go beyond that.

## Markdown [(slides)][md slides]
Markdown is the markup language you will be using to make your portfolio website.
This is the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) you should do first.

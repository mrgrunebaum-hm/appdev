Let's get ready to start our first mobile app design projects! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Github
Github is the platform we will use to host our portfolio websites – you will be submitting the vast majority of your labs as published pages on your website.

[Click on this link](https://github.com/) to make an account. Use your school email!

## Github Pages
Once you have a Github account and you are signed in, you can set up your portfolio website. Go to [the Beautiful Jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#build-your-website-in-3-steps) and follow the instructions.

Only do steps 1 and 2! Don't go beyond that.

## Markdown [(slides)][md slides]
Markdown is the markup language you will be using to make your portfolio website.
This is the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) you should do first.

> ⊕ bold, italics, headers, links, images, lists

The following are also good resources:

  ▲ [John Gruber's Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
  ▲ [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
  ▲ [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  ▲ [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  ▲ [Markdown Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/)

## Git
Much later on in this class, we will get started on implementing and testing your mobile app designs. Git is the version control system we'll be using for collaborative software development in this class.

  - **MacOS**: Git should come pre-installed. You can check by typing `git --version` into your Terminal. If it is not installed, you will get a prompt to install it.
  - **Windows**: [Click on this link](https://gitforwindows.org/) to download Git.

    Use the **default settings** during installation -- do not change anything unless you know what you are doing.

    **GitBash** is the Terminal that you will be using.

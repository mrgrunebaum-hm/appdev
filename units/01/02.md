## Reading
#### Due Monday

Please read [Chapter 1](The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-Chapter-1.pdf) from _The Design of Everyday Things_ for Monday. 

We will use terminology from this reading in an activity, in which we'll begin to think about how design impacts pretty much every aspect of life in modern society. We'll specifically be focusing on how to identify good and bad design both in the world and in our own strategizing.

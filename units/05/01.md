## Storyboards, Information Architecture, and Wireframing [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_UwiKCvD_WDXUBOmvZzOHRzehJv_8MOXATCgQ4Tlk4Y/edit?usp=sharing)

These are the slides from class. I have also linked some helpful articles where I found some of the images in the slides. These articles are excellent resources as you start to think about creating design sketches, storyboards, and, later on, wireframes. None of these are assigned asynchronously right now, but I may assign some of them as reading later.

## Graphic Design [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oMyST3RfofGQgSNouFWdeSYlxusEVSZLyPb2VJ3a0_I/edit?usp=sharing)

These are the slides from the class on graphic design concepts and applications. We will have a quiz next week on graphic design concepts, which will be open note. You are allowed to use these slides and linked articles, as well as any notes, when we have this quiz.

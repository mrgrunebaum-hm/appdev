## Storyboards, Information Architecture, and Wireframing [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_UwiKCvD_WDXUBOmvZzOHRzehJv_8MOXATCgQ4Tlk4Y/edit?usp=sharing)

These are the slides from class. I have also linked some helpful articles where I found some of the images in the slides. These articles are excellent resources as you start to think about creating design sketches, storyboards, and, later on, wireframes. Please read "Sketches and Models", "Task Flows", “Use Cases”, “Mood Boards”, and “Wireframes”, from _Designing for Interaction_ by Saffer, chapter 5, linked below.

**In class reading:** [Read 8.3 Conceptual Design, stopping after 8.3.3 Using scenarios in conceptual design (pages 249 - 261)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W3ZWV7AothRckJOUZjqCR4f8Po1QBlly/view?usp=sharing) 
(you can skim, and you should skip over any of the 'boxes', 'dilemmas' and activities)

## Graphic Design [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oMyST3RfofGQgSNouFWdeSYlxusEVSZLyPb2VJ3a0_I/edit?usp=sharing)

These are the slides from the class on graphic design concepts and applications. We will have a quiz next week on graphic design concepts, which will be open note. You are allowed to use these slides and linked articles, as well as any notes, when we have this quiz.

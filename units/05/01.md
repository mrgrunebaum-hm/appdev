## Storyboards, Information Architecture, and Wireframing [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_UwiKCvD_WDXUBOmvZzOHRzehJv_8MOXATCgQ4Tlk4Y/edit?usp=sharing)

These are the slides from class. I have also linked some helpful articles where I found some of the images in the slides. These articles are excellent resources as you start to think about creating design sketches, storyboards, and, later on, wireframes. None of these are assigned asynchronously right now, but I may assign some of them as reading later.

### This lab has two milestones:
  - **Contextual Inquiry Check-in, due Friday, December 10**
  - **Contextual Inquiry Review, due in class Friday, January 7 (Optional Draft Submission Due Friday, December 17)**

**Note:** All names of participants should be replaced with psuedonyms or a single first initial in all documents you submit to me. Even if your study seems harmless, it's important to protect the identity of your participants.

## Milestone 1: Contextual Inquiry Check-in
### Due Friday, December 10

Complete at least one contextual inquiry prior to this check-in. You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design, but also about how to conduct a contextual inquiry.

Describe your first inquiry:

  - Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
  - Any special prompting/instruction you used.
  - What did you learn?
  - What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?
  - Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?
  
Discuss what information and insights you will be pursuing in your next inquiries now that you have completed at least one. I fully expect changes will be necessary, as inquiries can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.

  - What are your plans for the remaining inquiries?
  - How do you plan to change your protocol based on what you learned in your first inquiry?
  
**Remember:** Your submission should not contain any real names of inquiry participants. All names should be replaced with psuedonyms or a single initial to protect the participants' identities.

**Submission Instructions:** No more than one page of text (~500 words). Post your team's _Contextual Inquiry Check-in_ to a page on your Project Website. One team member should turn in a link to the appropriate page on your Project Website as a submission for the _Contextual Inquiry Check-in_ assignment on the Google Classroom.

**Grading:** There are two sections of your _Contextual Inquiry Check-in_, the description of your first inquiry and your plans for the remaining inquiries. The grade for the check-in will be added to your total grade for the _Contextual Inquiry Review_. Each section of your _Contextual Inquiry Check-in_ will receive feedback indicating whether it's complete (A equivalent) or incomplete (and in what ways it's incomplete).

## Milestone 2: Contextual Inquiry Review
### Due Friday, January 7

Complete all three of your contextual inquiries (or design research methods). Discuss your process and what you learned:
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
  - Any special prompting/instruction you used.
  - Note anything unique about each inquiry and comment on the rationale behind these events.

Across the three inquiries, you should expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices. You should meet with your group members to compile your data surrounding these common themes, problems, and practices. We will be beginning to create affinity diagrams in class. While you are not required to complete your group's affinity diagram beyond what gets done in class, you may wish to do so as it will help you organize your thoughts to better answer the following questions regarding themes of your inquiries.
  - Identify high level themes the participants share in their practices. These would be the headings of different groupings in your affinity diagrams, which you may or may not have made yet.
  - Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks that are important to design for?
  - Describe your process for identifying these themes.
  
If you are having trouble identifying high level themes and problems from your inquiries, it may be a sign that you need to run an additional inquiry. You are required to run three inquiries, but you are not limited to only running three. These inquiries are critical for setting the foundation of your project, so ensure that you have strong findings from your inquiries before moving forward!
  
**Submission Instructions:** No more than three pages of text (3\*500 words):
  - summary of key findings or takeaways (one paragraph at beginning)
  - contextual inquiry participants: who did you interview and why, how did it go, specific takeaways from each interview (one page max)
  - contextual inquiry themes & process: how did you conduct the interviews and why did you choose your specific strategies, how did it go, go into more depth about specific takeaways from each interview, include a couple of sentences discussing high level themes and possible important tasks (one page max)
  
Your review should be submitted on Google Classroom as a link to a markdown post on your group project website.
  
**Grading:** 

You will receive qualitative feedback on the full report, as well a mark of complete, partially complete, or incomplete.

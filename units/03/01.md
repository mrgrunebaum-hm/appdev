## Team Contracts [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IBscpZ37lqZT13JAE-QJubsye55T7hXQthMW3QAObys/edit#slide=id.ga6bc86dc28_0_11)

We will begin with a free write about individual group members' hopes, concerns, expectations, goals, etc. for teamwork and dynamics as you go through the project process. We will then work in groups to begin drafting a team contract according to the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kht5wRoRS6JOhENj4IjIpsoOxWWQX_RwsZcY-JYXi2g/edit?usp=sharing) that I have shared with you. The [MIT team contract](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/projects/abcplayer/team-contract/#:~:text=A%20team%20contract%20is%20an,go%20into%20your%20team%20contract.) outline provided as an example in the slides is also helpful for thinking more broadly about what questions your contract should answer and how it should be organized.

Team contracts are due as part of the [*Group Project Proposal*]({{sitebase.url}}/units/02/03) assignment and should be submitted in the form of a separate post on your group's project website, titled "Team Contract".

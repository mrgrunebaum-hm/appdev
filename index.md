# Description
Software has become ubiquitous in our lives and, as such, the principles of human computer interaction (HCI) and how they are put into practice in the design, implementation, and evaluation of software applications has an immeasurable impact on modern society and on our day to day lives. This course provides an introduction to the application design process through the lens of human computer interaction and user centered design strategies as well as the opportunity to learn and practice working with skills and frameworks for app development. We will draw not only on computer science skills, but also on social and cognitive sciences, art, philosophy, and much between the lines of these disciplines. 

The goal of _App Development_ is to develop the skills necessary to design and create high quality, useful, intuitive, accessible, ethical, and beautiful software products. For much of this course, we will not be developing apps but rather will be learning skills and techniques to answer the crucial questions that go into  application development. These questions include but are not limited to: How do I know if my app idea is a good one? Who will use this tech? How will they use it? What problems will my app solve? Is my app ethical? How will I develop my app? If something goes wrong with my app, how do I fix it? What tools can I use to develop an app? What exactly is an app anyway?

Much like a high quality piece of software, this course is necessarily a living thing – a work in progress. As we work together through the process of designing interactive software applications, we will see how far we can go in designing, evaluating, and implementing novel ideas alongside our teammates. By the end of the year, students will have a newly attuned eye for evaluating design at both ends of the quality spectrum, a completed design research project in their portfolio, and – perhaps – the next big, paradigm-shifting piece of tech!

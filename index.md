# Description
Mobile technology has become ubiquitous in our lives and, as such, the principles of human computer interaction (HCI) and how they are put into practice in the design, implementation, and evaluation of mobile applications has a great impact on modern society and on our day to day lives. This course provides an introduction to the mobile application design process through the lens of human computer interaction and user centered design strategies. We will draw not only on computer science skills, but also on social and cognitive sciences, art, philosophy, and much between the lines of these disciplines. 

The goal of _Mobile Apps_ is to develop the skills necessary to design and create high quality, useful, intuitive, accessible, ethical, and enjoyable mobile software. For much of this course, we will not be developing apps but rather will be learning skills and techniques to answer the crucial questions that go into mobile application development. These questions include but are not limited to: How do I know if my app idea is a good one? Who will use my app? How will they use it? What problems will my app solve? Is my app ethical? How will I develop my app? If something goes wrong with my app, how do I fix it? What tools can I use to develop a mobile app? 

Much like a high quality mobile app, this course is a living thing – a work in progress. As we work together through the process of designing interactive mobile applications, we will see how far we can go in designing, evaluating, and implementing novel mobile apps alongside our teammates. By the end of the year, students will have a newly attuned eye for evaluating design at both ends of the quality spectrum, a completed design project in their portfolio, and – who knows – maybe the next big app to disrupt the App Store!

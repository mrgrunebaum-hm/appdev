# Overview
Coursework in _Mobile Apps_ can be divided most neatly into two categories: group and individual work. Group work includes things like labs (mostly related to your yearlong project), smaller homework assignments, and in-class activities. Individual is mostly comprised of quizzes and smaller homework assignments, as well as a smaller scale individual project. If you complete the weekly labs in a timely fashion, the only work necessary to complete the final project will be to nicely package all of the work you did in a professional looking website and create a presentation of you and your teammates' work. 

## Class Expectations
My goal is to build an environment where you feel safe, comfortable, and supported enough to try your best, share your ideas, make mistakes, and learn. We will work together to set classroom norms at the beginning of the year and revisit them as the term progresses. Our vibe will be one of respect, professionalism, and fun!

## Discussions
Topical readings will be given to supplement the course material. Each reading will include a written response (this may take many forms), as well as participation in an in-class discussion. These will be graded on a completion basis. 

## Assessments: Quizzes and Labs
Quizzes will only ever cover topics from homeworks or in-class lessons and discussions. They will be given in the middle of each unit and will always be taken _individually_.

Labs assess your ability to put into practice the concepts discussed in class and in homework assignments. Most labs will be comprised of one or more steps ('milestones') in the process of designing and creating a novel app, as well as a corresponding write-up. Labs will be given at the end of each unit, although you may hear about them earlier. Details will be provided when due dates for these assessments are given.

### Retakes and Revisions
We will often have quiz retakes as a class, but individual retakes are also an option. On any given quiz, only your most recent attempt will count toward your grade.

Lab revisions are handled on a case-by-case basis.

# Academic Honesty
Any submitted work by a student should be their own, unless students are collaborating on a group assignment, in which case the work submitted should be a reflection of equal effort of all students involved. Collaboration is always encouraged – feel free to talk with other students! However, students must always  **cite** who they worked with on final submissions of assignments.

Any form of cheating will result in a **failing grade** on that particular assignment and the student’s grade dean and advisor will be notified for the first offense. Forms of cheating include but are not limited to: similar / identical writing or code submitted, solutions submitted that are not a student’s own work, submission of fabricated or otherwise unreliable data.

**I would rather you submit something late than something academically dishonest.** If you are ever unsure, reach out to me! I want to help you succeed in this class.
